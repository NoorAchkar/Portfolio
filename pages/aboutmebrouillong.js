              Hi, my name is Noor Maria Achkar and I am a Senior studying Computer Engineering at the University of Notre demonstrates.
              I am originally from Beirut, Lebanon where I attended Coll√®ge Notre Dame de Jamhour. I passed the French Baccalaureate with
              Honors for General Sciences, emphasis on Sciences and Mathematics (SG). Some of my activities and societes included:
              Model United Nations Team (NDJMUN), Patrol Leader at the school-affiliated Scouts Program (GNDJ - Les Scouts du Liban),
              Student Government (Class and Grade Representative). I volunteered at AFEL (Association du Foyer de l'Enfant Libanais) and 
              at DSC (Donner Sang Compter). I also lived in Abu Dhabi, the United Arab Emirates.
            </p>

              <Image src={notre_dame} alt="picture of notre dame" width={100} height={100} />
            </image-fix>
            <p>   
              At Notre Dame, I am currently an Incoming Research Assistant for Spring 2024. I am a member of the Board of the French Club.
              Fall 2023, I was a Fundamentals of Computing Teaching Assistant and was very lucky to get selected to attend the Grace Hopper
              Conference. That same semester, I made the Dean's List. During the Spring of the same year, I was fortunate enough to
              intern and study in Silicon Valley. Before that, I worked for the Center for the Study of Languages and 
              Cultures as an Arabic Tutor and was a Signature Events Commissioner for my dorm, Johnson Family Hall.

              I am passionate about problem solving, Product and Project Mangement, UX/UI design, Human Computer Interactions and Computer Graphics.
              I have a wide variety of skills: from computing (Matlab, C, C++, Pyhton, Vue.js, Javascript, CSS, HTML, Figma) to business tools 
              and processes (Microsoft PowerPoint, Microsoft Excel, Azure DevOps, SAP Products). Additionally, I possess proficiency in project 
              management, collaborative teamwork, organizational skills and adaptation skills.
              Two current certificates I have accomplished are:

              Some fun facts about me: I am a native speaker of three languages (French, Arabic, and English), 
              and am learning a fourth (Spanish). I enjoy Skiing, Yoga, Reading, Traveling, and Mediterranean Cuisine
